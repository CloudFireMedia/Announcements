\
Recurring Content is automatically added to each new Sunday page as it is created.  \
Recurring Content directives are added to the page entitles, aptly enough, [ RECURRING CONTENT ]<br>\
<br>\
<h3>Directives</h3>\
Recurring content directives should be enclosed in two sets of angle brackets:<br>\
<< first, last, 04.22, before fifth >><br>\
<br>\
Multiple directives can be included and each will be processed.<br>\
Directives can duplicate content so use care.<br>\
e.g.: << fifth, last >> will give you two entries if there is a fifth Sunday<br>\
<br>\
Only the first set of options in angle brackets (<< >>) is processed. <br>\
Additional sets are considered part of the content.<br>\
<br>\
Commas are optional but help with readability.<br>\
Extra spaces are ignored.<br>\
\
<h3>Valid Options</h3>\
<dl>\
\
<dt>Ordinals</dt>\
<dd>\
Example: << first, second, third, fourth, fifth, last >><br>\
Shown when the week ordinal matches the directive.<br>\
\"Fifth\" will not be shown if the month has no fifth Sunday.  Use \"last\" for this.<br>\
\"Last\" will be shown on the Fourth or Fifth as appropriate.<br>\
<br><br>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>Sunday Before Fifth Sunday</dt>\
<dd>\
Example: << before fifth >><br>\
Shown on the fourth Sunday only when there is a fifth Sunday in the month.<br>\
<br><br>\
</dd>\
\
<dt>Specified Date</dt>\
<dd>\
Example: << 04.22, 10.28 >><br>\
Shown on the exact date only.<br>\
If the date given is not a Sunday, it will not be shown.<br>\
Note that the format requires the leading zero if the month or day is a single digit.<br>\
